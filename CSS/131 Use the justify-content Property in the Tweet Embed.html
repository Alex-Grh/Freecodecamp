Use the justify-content Property in the Tweet Embed
The last challenge showed an example of the justify-content property. For the tweet embed, this property can be applied to align the items in the .profile-name element.

Add the CSS property justify-content to the header's .profile-name element and set the value to any of the options from the last challenge.

Your .follow-btn should be rendered on the page. Be sure to turn off any extensions such as ad blockers.

The .profile-name element should have the justify-content property set to any of these values: center, flex-start, flex-end, space-between, space-around, or space-evenly.
